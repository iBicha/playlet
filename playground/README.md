# Playground

Playground is a test project to try things out or iterate on a concept.

Playlet app relies on playlet lib, and playlet lib relies on web app, so sometimes iteration speed can be slower when building everything everytime.

Just like Playlet, Playground can be launched from the VSCode "Run and debug" menu.
